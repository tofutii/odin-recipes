# odin-recipes
Hello! My name is Kero and this project is going to be a recipes website for The Odin Project :D 
I aim to showcase my ability to write clean-looking HTML in an accessible way. (for people with screen readers etc.)
I also aim to showcase my ability of knowing when to push my code and create easy to understand commits! 
I will be doing a small review below after I have completed the project, showcasing what I've learned c:

Thank you so much for this fun and exciting project TOP! Here's to tasty new knowledge~

**Post completion review:**
I definitely learned alot! This project was really fun for me. I feel like I spent most of my time making sure the formats were correct and making sure it was all aesthetically pleasing with what I've learned so far- sometimes that was prioritized over functionality, but I believe I was able to reprioritze functionality and make sure I had a working web-page first before I made it look nice.

I learned about nesting lists, I did not use this, but I enjoyed messing around with it for my Pomodoro Sauce recipe!

I also learned the importance of resources, I found myself looking up ratio calculators to make sure my images weren't taking up the whole recipe page. I also looked up different ways to say "enjoy your meal" so I could make sure the recipes were fitted with the phrase in its origin's native language. That was quite fun too! Although it was quite suplimental and not required of the project, I feel like I learned alot not just in details but also just enjoying the process.
