    <h2>Notes from Grandpappy:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This is a very forgiving recipe.<br>
        Take all ingredients and quantities for the stuff following the hot cooked rice as guides.<br>
         It always seems to work well using a bit more or less of any item depending on how well you happen to like an item or don't like the item.<br> 
         OR, how much you happen to have. If it's something you just can't stand, or don't have,it'll most likelynever be missed.<br>
         If there is something you like and think it might go well in the mix give it a try on a small sample. I throw in some small salad shrimp (well really quite a bunch.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Notes from Kero:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In the original recipe my grandfather includes 2 diced hard boiled eggs, however I couldn't find a good vegan substitute for that so I left it out of the ingredients list.<br>
        I'm planning to try vegan scrambled egg in place.. so I'll update here how it tastes once I give it a try!<br> 
    I'd also maybe add some corn and black beans if you're looking for more protein, also some cashews if you want a crunch :)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>In honor of E.B. you are very loved and very missed!</em></p>
