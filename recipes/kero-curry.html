        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is one of my all time favorites! It's super filling and tasty, perfect for a cold night or for after a tiring day where you need something simple to make.<br>
        I made this recipe after discovering a box of Golden Curry at my local asian market and could not for the life of me find a simple vegan recipe<br>
        like the non-vegan ones on the back of the box... So I made one myself!!<br>
        I pass this recipe on with love, in hopes that it can bring some comfort and nourishment for others.<br>

        <p><strong>Serves:</strong> 4 <br><strong>Prep time:</strong> 15 min <br><strong>Cook time:</strong> 20 min</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 carrots, peeled and sliced into circles</li>
            <li>1 large potato, washed and largly diced</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion, halved and cut into wedges</1i>
            <li>1 clove of garlic, minced or grated</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups of water</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp of veggie bouillon <small>(or other plant based bouillon of choice)</small></li>
            <li>1 tbsp of agave or maple syrup</li>
            <li>400g of pressed and diced firm tofu</li>
            <li>1 portion of a boxed curry mix (S&B Golden Curry is recommended** but other mixes such as House Java or <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-curry-roux/">homemade</a> roux work as well)</li>
            <li>Powdered ginger/salt/pepper to personal taste</li>
            <li>3 tbsp of a neutral oil</li>
            <li>Jasmine rice to serve (I recommend following this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1Sv_dWLxSY">video tutorial</a> to make the perfect rice!)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>While your tofu is pressing, heat 2 tbsp of oil in a large pot on medium high heat and add in your carrots, potato and onion; season with some salt, pepper and ground ginger to your taste.</li>
            <li>Mix and fry until the veggies have a good color (about 5-7 minutes)</li>
            <li>Add garlic, water, syrup and bouillon to the pot with the veggies and bring to a simmer</li>
            <li>Once brought to a simmer, cover the pot and place on low heat for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>On a separate burner, heat the remaining oil in a pan on medium-high heat and add in your diced tofu; season with powdered ginger, salt and pepper to your liking.</li>
            <li>Fry the tofu until it is browned on all sides (8-10 minutes), add more oil if needed.</li>
            <li>Once 15 minutes has passed for your veggies, turn off the heat and add in your curry blocks.</li>
            <li>Stir your curry mixture until the blocks have melted and add in your tofu</li>
            <li>Turn back on your burner and simmer for about 5 minutes more on medium heat</li>
            <li>Serve over rice!</li>
        </ol>

        **<em>1 portion of S&B Curry roux should equal one small package and split into 4 equal blockss</em>
