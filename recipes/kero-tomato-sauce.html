        <p><strong>Description</strong><br>
        This recipe is for a simple Pomodoro sauce! There's lots of room for customization and additions, one of my favorites is adding toasted pine nuts... mmmm!<br>
        I first found this recipe in Katheryn Nicolai's book "<a href="https://www.nothingmuchhappens.com/book-store/p/nothing-much-happens">Nothing Much Happens</a>" and adjusted it to my personal tastes. This recipe follows my personal adjustments, I hope you enjoy-<br>
        <em>Buon appetito!~</em></p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 800g can of whole San Marzano tomatoes (technically any brand of whole peeled tomatoes work, but I recommend San Marzano)</li>
            <li>5 tbsp of quality extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/3 yellow onion, thinly sliced</li>

        <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Empty your can of tomatoes into a large bowl and crush the whole tomatoes with your hands (make sure to wash your hands first!)</li>
            <li>Heat your pan over medium heat, once heated, add your olive oil and sliced onion</li>
            <li>Cook the onion slices until they are translucent and have some color</li>
            <li>Add your now crushed tomatoes into the pan along with 1/4 tsp of salt (optional: tear and add in your basil leaves in this step)</li>
            <li>Lower your heat to low and cook for 20-25 minutes (optional: cover your pan for a thinner sauce)</li>
            <li>Serve over pasta and add vegan-friendly toppings of your choice!</li>
        </ol>

        <strong><em>**For pine nuts</em></strong>
