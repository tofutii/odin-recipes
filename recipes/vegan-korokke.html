        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my own vegan spin on Japanese Korokke! I got the original recipe from Christie Lai's <a href="https://christieathome.com/blog/korokke-japanese-potato-croquettes/#recipe">Easy & Simple Korokke Recipe</a><br>
        and made it my own! It took some trial and error to get the battering process right, but I am happy to say that I was very successfull<br>
        in getting them to stay together! They also make for perfect meal preps and can easily be frozen, which I will go more in depth in the recipe notes.<br>
        I hope that everyone enjoys these as much as I have!!<br>

        <p><strong>Serves:</strong> 4-6<br> <strong>Prep time:</strong> 30 min<br> <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 20 min</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the Potato Mixture:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds of medium russet potatoes, <em>washed and halved</em></li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of vegan butter</li>
            <li>2/3 cup of non-dairy milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1 small yellow onion, <em>small diced</em></li>
            <li>1 small-medium carrot, <em>small diced</em></li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic, <em>minced</em></li>
            <li>250g vegan minced meat* <br>
            <em>(I like using the pre-coooked Veganes Mühlen Hack from Ruegenwalder, but you can<br>
                make your own with some beyond or impossible ground and cook it up to make little minced pieces)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Batter/Coating:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup of non-dairy milk</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of cornstarch <em>(potato starch, tapioca starch, or flour also works!)</em></li>
            <li>1/2 cup of fine panko breadcrumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Dipping Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons of ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of vegan yakitori sauce or another vegan sweet barbecue sauce <em>(I recommend the Kikkoman brand)</em></li>
            <li>5 teaspoons of vegan Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 1/2 teaspoons of granulated sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash your potatoes and halve or quarter them, then place in a pot with cold water and bring to a boil.<br> 
                Once the water is boiling, set a timer and boil the potatoes loosely covered for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, chop and fry your onions and carrots in 1-2 tablespoons of oil, adding in your garlic towards the end until everything is soft and caramelized.<br>
            Place into a mixing bowl, and add your cooked vegan mince. Season with salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Once the potatoes are cooked, drain and mash them, incorporating the butter, and then slowly adding your non-dairy milk to the potato mash until the consistency is malleable.<br> 
            <em>(You want a texture that is not too dry, and also not too soft. They will be done when you can pick up a chunk with a spoon or fork, and they do not crumble or sink.)</em></li>
            <li>Combine your veggie/mince mixture into the mashed potatoes and then divide the batter into 15-20 equal portions. <br>
                Roll them into little oval shaped balls and place them into the fridge for 15 minutes. <em>(Do not skip this step or you will have a difficult time coating them)</em></li>
            <li>In one bowl add your corn starch. In a second bowl place your non-dairy milk of choice. And lastly, in a third bowl, add your panko breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Coat each ball first in your non-dairy milk, and then dip into your cornstarch mixture until evenly coated.<br> 
                Then dip back into the non-dairy milk and lastly, coat with your panko breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Heat 1-2 cups of oil over medium heat in a large pan. To test if it's ready, place a wooden chopstick and look for bubbles.<br>
                If you spot bubbles, it's time to deep fry! <em>(If you do not have wooden chopsticks, test by throwing one of the panko crumbs into the oil, if it forms a lot of bubbles, it's ready.)</em></li>
            <li>Deep fry for 1-2 minutes on each side until crispy and golden brown and place on a towel or wire rack to remove excess oil.</li>
            <li>Once your frying is completed, combine all the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl using a whisk.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your fresh korokke with your tasty sauce!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To freeze the korokke for meal prepping, place the freshly battered and coated korokke on a sheet of parchment paper. <br>
            Layer the parchment paper as needed and place into a container and into the freezer. From here you can pick back up at step 7 without any modifications.</li>
            <li>If you would like to air-fry these instead of deep frying, pre-heat your air fryer at 200 C (400 F), and cook for 20 minutes, flipping halfway.<br>
            If you choose to prep and freeze your korokke, you can also air-fry them without any modifications.</li>
        </ul>
