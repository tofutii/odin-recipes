        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a variation of my <a href="./kero-curry.html">tofu curry!</a><br>
        One day it just popped into my head, I had never had it but had seen it all over the animes I was watching and decided to give it a try!<br>
        It ended up being SOO simple and filling, I had to share it here! Its perfect for those cold Februrary and March evenings.<br>
        I adjusted it to be the perfect dish for 2 people so feel free to double as needed.<br>

        <p><strong>Serves:</strong> 2<br><strong>Prep time:</strong> 10 min<br><strong>Cook time:</strong> 15 min</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Half of my <a href="./kero-curry.html"> tofu curry recipe</a> - omit the potatoes and tofu</li>
            <li>Jasmine rice to serve (I recommend following this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1Sv_dWLxSY">video tutorial</a> to make the perfect rice!)</li>
            <li>2 Vegan schnitzel cutlets either homemade or storebought (I personally love the Vivera brand from Europe!)<br>
            <em>If making homemade, I highly recommend this <a href="https://www.elephantasticvegan.com/seitan-schnitzel/#wprm-recipe-container-14449">recipe for vegan schnitzel</a></em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the vegan schnitzel cutlets as instructed depending on if making homemade or storebought.</li>
            <li>While your vegan cutlets are cooking, follow my <a href="./kero-curry">tofu curry recipe</a> while omitting steps 1 and 6, and halving all the ingredients.<br> 
            <em>Since the recipe is halved, the cook time is also lessened. Only simmer the curry for a maximum of 7 minutes</em></li>
            <li>Once your vegan schnitzel is done baking/frying, cut it into individual strips.</li>
            <li>Then assemble! Order: Rice, sliced vegan schnitzel, curry, enjoy!</li>
